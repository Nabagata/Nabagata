# Nabagata Saha -- @nabagata

Hi, I'm Nabagata, a graduate from NIT Warangal and currently working at Sprinklr, Integrations team. I apply deep learning to solve real-world problems in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Check out my work from my public repositories ✌️

Previously, I've worked at IISc Bangalore where I've developed projects for MILE Lab and published research papers([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00961) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05411)). I've also worked with SkyLark Labs where I've used cutting edge computer vision and deep learning technologies to identify suspicious events in CCTV or aerial videos.

Off the work, I enjoy building and working with dev communities. I've been mentoring fellow students for MLH Hacks & GirlScript and talking at developer [meetups and conferences](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/bertelsmann-challenge/community/student-conference?authuser=0#h.p_ETRLRhvMrXLi).
